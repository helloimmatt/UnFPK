# UnFPK


## Introduction
UnFPK is a simple yet fast and reliable unpacker for FPK and FPKD files designed for Fox Engine-based games, capable of recursively searching the game folder for such files and extracting them all into one universal output directory.
Although it is currently only supported on Windows, macOS and Linux compatibility is planned.

## Usage
```
unfpk -i "[Game Directory]" -o "[Output Directory]"
```
